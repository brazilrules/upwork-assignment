# Tree

To run the Tree project, first run `npm install` in Client/js and Server folders. Then you run `npm start` on the Server folder and open the `index.html` file in the Client folder.
If you make any changes to the Client/js files, run `npm run build` to bundle the javascript files.

# Form

 To run the Form project you just need to open the `index.html` file on the root folder. If you change any files in the js folder, run `npm run build` on that same folder.
